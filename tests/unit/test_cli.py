"""The CLI entry point — currently just the encoding guard.

Two bugs, same root cause, found one after the other against a real host.

`uv tool install .` on a stock Windows shell, then `vaultcompute hook
session-start` with a config declaring any protected path, crashed with

    UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '⟦'
    in position 195: character maps to <undefined>

at `print(json.dumps(response, ...))` in run_hook — stdout. Fixed by forcing
UTF-8 on stdout/stderr. That fix shipped, and the next real reproduction
surfaced the other half: `hook message-display` on a message containing a real
placeholder returned nothing at all — no crash, no error, no output — because
`sys.stdin.read()` mis-decodes ⟦/⟧ under the same default codepage, and unlike
the write side this does not raise. It silently produces a different
character, TOKEN_PATTERN never matches, and the hook answers "nothing to do."
Confirmed by running the identical call with and without PYTHONIOENCODING set:
one resolves the token, the other produces no output and no error — see
git history for the transcript.

The token delimiters are U+27E6/U+27E7; Windows' default console codepage
(cp1252) cannot represent them, and nothing sets PYTHONIOENCODING for a binary
a host invokes by bare name — which is exactly how the plugin's hooks and MCP
server run `vaultcompute`.

These tests use fakes rather than an actual cp1252 stream, so the check is
deterministic on every platform CI runs on, including the Linux and macOS
runners where the bug cannot reproduce natively.
