"""Collective tokens: one placeholder for a whole table, and a fixed set of
operations over it.

Individual tokens stop being useful somewhere around a few dozen rows. Not
because of size — a current token is 38 characters and *replaces* the value it hides,
measured at +3% on a 500-row response back when it was 14 — but because a few hundred unordered
opaque strings carry no structure. The model cannot sort them, cannot tell they
are comparable quantities, and to use ``blindfold_compute`` would have to
enumerate every one by hand in its code. In practice it processes a subset and
reports a confident wrong answer.

So a declared table becomes **one** token, and the model is told the column
names and what they mean. It then submits a query, not code.

**The query language is a fixed set of operations, executed here.** That is the
point of the whole exercise, and it is worth being explicit about why:

- ``blindfold_compute`` runs arbitrary Python, so the model can write code whose
  *success* depends on a hidden value (``1/0 if resolve(t) > 50000 else 'ok'``)
  and read one bit per call. No sandbox closes that, because nothing about such
  code is illegal.
- These operations cannot express that. Every well-formed query succeeds, and
  every result leaves as a new token. Comparisons between values of different
  types do not raise — they simply do not match — precisely so that no failure
  can carry information about the data.

That invariant is why this path needs no sandbox at all: no code the model wrote
is ever executed.
