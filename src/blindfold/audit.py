"""`blindfold audit` — check a transcript against the vault.

A privacy tool has an observability problem that most tools do not: **when it
works, the screen looks exactly the same as when it is not installed.** In
Mode C especially, the display hook puts real values back before you read them,
so the frontend cannot tell you whether anything was ever hidden.

The ground truth is the transcript — what the model actually received — and the
answer is not a grep, because knowing whether a value leaked means knowing
which values were supposed to be hidden. That is what the vault holds.

So: for every record in the vault, look for its value in the transcript. A hit
is a leak. It reports placeholders too, because "no leaks" is also what an
empty config produces, and the two need telling apart.

What it cannot tell you: a field you never declared was never tokenized, so
there is no vault record and nothing to look for. This audit measures whether
Blindfold kept the promises your config made, not whether the config named
everything it should have.

One more case worth naming: a ``blindfold_compute`` result can be a string
literal the model already typed into its own code — picking between two
already-known names based on a hidden comparison, say. That text was never
secret; it sat in the transcript, in plain sight, in the tool call's own
arguments, before the token wrapping it even existed. Flagging its later
reappearance as a leak was a real false positive. It is excluded now —
reported separately, as "explained" — but only for records ``blind_compute``
minted, and only when the matched text is provably a literal the model wrote
itself; a value actually pulled out of ``resolve(...)`` (a computed sum, say)
is still flagged exactly as before.
