"""Configuration loader for blindfold.yaml.

Only the sections this release consumes (`schemas`, `resources`, `tokens`,
`storage`) are
modeled. Unknown top-level keys are tolerated so future config additions do not
break older Blindfold binaries.

Tolerated does not extend to keys inside a section that *is* modeled: asking
for a backend or a guarantee this release does not have raises at load, rather
than being ignored into a config that says one thing and does another.
