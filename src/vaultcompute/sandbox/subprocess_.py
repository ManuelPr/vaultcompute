"""SubprocessSandbox — best-effort isolation via a fresh Python subprocess.

The invariant that matters: **nothing derived from a resolved value may appear
in what this module returns or raises.** The only sanctioned way out of the
sandbox is `result`, which the caller stores as a new vault token. Error text
is a second way out, so it carries exception *types*, never messages, and
never child output. Detail goes to the operator's stderr instead.

Current limitations (see LIMITATIONS.md#sandboxing):
- Builtins are an allow-list, so `open` and `__import__` are gone and the
  direct routes to the filesystem and the network with them. Not an escape
  proof: `object.__subclasses__()` needs no builtins at all.
- The network is therefore not reachable the easy way, and still not denied.
  Denying it means a container or platform-specific namespace work.
- Success-versus-failure still leaks one bit per call, and no sandbox closes
  that — only a fixed operation set would.
- Defenses actually in place: clean env, `python -I`, timeout, subprocess
  boundary, and the error-channel hygiene above.
